Data Traffic Control
====================

*Whhrrrr... Voooooosh... That's the sound of your data coming and going exactly where it belongs.*

data traffic control is a python package that automates every-day interactions with your data files.
Data files are the building materials we work with every day, all day. Working with them should be effortless!

Main Features

 * Navigate your data directories with ease, without having to memorize long file paths.
 * Load data files without having to think about it (or looking it up the syntax yet again).
 * Be certain of how a datafile was generated, and rest easy knowing you could reproduce it.
